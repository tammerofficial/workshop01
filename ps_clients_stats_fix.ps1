Write-Host "=== Client Statistics Fix Summary ===" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "- Client statistics were showing total count of all WooCommerce orders instead of per-client orders"
Write-Host "- Total Value was showing $0.00 instead of actual client order values"
Write-Host "- This happened because loadClientStats was using orderService.getOrdersByClient() which wasn't returning all orders correctly"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "1. Modified loadClientStats function in src/pages/Clients.tsx"
Write-Host "   - Changed from orderService.getOrdersByClient(client.id) to orderService.getAll()"
Write-Host "   - Added client_id filtering on frontend: allOrders.data.filter((order: Order) => order.client_id === client.id)"
Write-Host "   - This ensures we get ALL orders for the specific client, including WooCommerce orders"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "2. Enhanced Client Interface"
Write-Host "   - Added client_id: number to Order interface for proper filtering"
Write-Host "   - Maintained existing lazy loading with 'Load' button for performance"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "3. Improved Error Handling"
Write-Host "   - Added proper type checking for total_cost values"
Write-Host "   - Enhanced console logging for debugging order filtering"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "TECHNICAL DETAILS:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "- Function: loadClientStats(client: Client)"
Write-Host "- New Logic: Fetch all orders -> Filter by client_id -> Calculate totals"
Write-Host "- Performance: Lazy loading prevents unnecessary API calls"
Write-Host "- Data Accuracy: Each client now shows their specific order count and total value"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:" -ForegroundColor Magenta
Write-Host "1. Navigate to Clients page"
Write-Host "2. Click 'Load' button next to any client's order count"
Write-Host "3. Verify the count shows only that client's orders"
Write-Host "4. Click 'View Profile' and check Total Value shows correct amount"
Write-Host "5. Verify 'Client Orders' section shows only that client's orders"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "EXPECTED RESULTS:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "- Each client shows their individual order count (not total system orders)"
Write-Host "- Total Value reflects actual sum of that client's orders"
Write-Host "- Client profile shows only orders belonging to that specific client"
Write-Host "- WooCommerce orders are properly linked to their respective clients"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "FILES MODIFIED:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "- src/pages/Clients.tsx: Updated loadClientStats function"
Write-Host "- Enhanced Order interface with client_id field"
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "STATUS: COMPLETED" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Client statistics now correctly show per-client data instead of system-wide totals."
