Write-Host "🔧 FIXED: React Object Rendering Error in Workers Section" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "========================================================" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "`n📋 Problem Description:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "- Console Error: 'Uncaught Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {sync, data, lastSync})'"
Write-Host "- Error originated from WorkerCard.tsx and Workers.tsx"
Write-Host "- The t('workers.biometric') was returning an object instead of a string"

Write-Host "`n🔍 Root Cause Analysis:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "- In src/locales/en.json and src/locales/ar.json:"
Write-Host "  workers.biometric: {"
Write-Host "    sync: 'Sync from Biometric' / 'مزامنة من البصمة'"
Write-Host "    data: 'Biometric Data' / 'بيانات البصمة'"
Write-Host "    lastSync: 'Last Sync' / 'آخر مزامنة'"
Write-Host "  }"
Write-Host "- Components were trying to render the entire object as a React child"

Write-Host "`n✅ Changes Made:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "`n1. Fixed src/components/workers/WorkerCard.tsx:"
Write-Host "   - Line 74: Changed t('workers.biometric') → t('workers.biometric.data')"
Write-Host "   - This now displays 'Biometric Data' / 'بيانات البصمة' instead of object"

Write-Host "`n2. Fixed src/pages/Workers.tsx:"
Write-Host "   - Line 587: Changed t('workers.biometric') → t('workers.biometric.data')"
Write-Host "   - This fixes the same issue in table view"

Write-Host "`n🧪 Validation:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "- ✅ No linter errors in both modified files"
Write-Host "- ✅ Translation keys resolve to proper strings:"
Write-Host "  - EN: 'Biometric Data'"
Write-Host "  - AR: 'بيانات البصمة'"

Write-Host "`n🚀 Result:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "- React object rendering error eliminated"
Write-Host "- Biometric badges now display proper text instead of [object Object]"
Write-Host "- Workers page should load without console errors"

Write-Host "`n📝 Files Modified:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "- src/components/workers/WorkerCard.tsx"
Write-Host "- src/pages/Workers.tsx"

Write-Host "`n✨ Status: COMPLETED" -ForegroundColor Green
